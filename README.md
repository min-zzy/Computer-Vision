# Computer-Vision
* Implemented a ResNet-34 model by hyper-parameter tuning and data augmentations through PyTorch.
* Applied advanced inference strategies, including multi-crop techniques and ensemble methods, culminating in higher classification test accuracy; adhered to optimizing within a 30M parameter limit.
